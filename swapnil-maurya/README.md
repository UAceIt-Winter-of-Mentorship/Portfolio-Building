## Conclusion
 
    Throughout this portfolio anyone can see my work
    All of the work I composed onto this file was the journey
    I went throughthis course. Each project has a prompt and 
    its own individual purpose for us to seek andcomplete.
    Every material I worked on had its own different skills.
    Online environments will be so important in the world
    you have to work in as an professional, and hopefully now
    feel confident in abilities to work online. 



## Future scope
