## Conclusion & Website link

This project was inspired by two beautiful personal portfolio websites I saw a while back, these included- 

Sean Halpin's website
(https://web.archive.org/web/20180819202235js_/http://seanhalpin.io/), whose cover art inspired me to make one for myself, playing with positions of different objects in CSS.

The second website was the interactive website of Pascal van Gemert (http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/#/profile), whose interactive website was something I aspired for and was able to make to a certain extent.

There were many other resources and websites that helped me gather my vision and make my idea come to life! I would like to thank my mentor, Radha Singh for helping me through this as well as she has been a huge resource in this project's completion. 


With this, I present to you, my personal portfolio website-

## Future Scope

Future scope of the project includes updating the portfolio website with new achievements, projects and new knowledge gained. The website can also be made more interactive by implementing new languages like JavaScript,etc.
